# COMP-258-Group01-Project

## Project Requirement:
Create an application to automate classification/prediction tasks. Develop a full-stack app composed of:
1.	A friendly UI that allows users and administrators to use/administer the system.
2.	Structured and/or unstructured data access API.
3.	A modern backend API to perform classification/prediction tasks.
You will have to sign the non-disclosure agreement for using the dataset.

You are supposed to use Neural Networks and build a full-stack intelligent solution for 1st year student persistence problem. 

Apply the correct architectural patterns for both frontend and backend parts.
